# 🍛 Home of Flavors

Hey there!  
This is my project — **Home of Flavors** — a simple yet elegant landing page for an Indian restaurant made using **HTML5** and **Tailwind CSS (CDN version)**.  
It's responsive, neat, and showcases dishes, testimonials, contact info, and a little about me too :)

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

- 🎯 Hero section with headline and call-to-action buttons
- 🍽️ Specialties section showing dishes with images
- 💬 Customer testimonials
- 📞 Contact form with address, email, and phone
- 🧑‍💻 About Me section (yep, it’s me!)
- 📱 Fully responsive on all screen sizes (mobile to desktop)

---

## 🔧 Tech Used

- HTML5  
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)  
- Google Fonts  

No backend — just a clean and static frontend.
